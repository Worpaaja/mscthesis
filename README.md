# This the repository for my masters thesis at University of Oulu

Remember to set privileges to scripts with chmod +x <script.sh>.

masterscript.sh has been created so that cloning the repo and running install.sh should be enough to start all scripts in a sequence.

## HOW TO USE
1) clone or download repo
2) use: chmod +x install.sh
3) run install.sh
4) run masterscript.sh number_of_runs
   For the number of runs, the thesis used 50. Running the masterscript with 50 on the used older laptop took over 8 hours.
